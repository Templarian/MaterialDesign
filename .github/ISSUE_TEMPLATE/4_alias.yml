        Icon aliases are provide different names the help yourself and others find the icons you are looking for.
        Aliases *do not* provide you a different way to call a specific icon in your code.

        For example, `account` has an alias of `user`. You can search for "user" on [our website](https://www.materialdesignicons.com), but you must use `account` when refering to the icon in your code.
