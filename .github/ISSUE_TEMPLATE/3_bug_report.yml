        ### IMPORTANT ⤵️ 

        If you see an icon on the site, but it is not in the latest release, *this is not a bug*. When new icons are added the library, they will immediately show on [MaterialDesignIcons.com](https://materialdesignicons.com/). However, a new release must happen before they will be available in our packages.
        
        See our [history log](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/history/) for more information.
